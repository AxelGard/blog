# Paper-trader to cira
I have decided to move [paper-trader](https://github.com/AxelGard/paper-trader) the library cira.

This was of course easy to do, due to that I'm the developer as well as that cira is essentially a fork of the trader/ from paper-trader.   

With this move to cira I hop that paper-trader will serve as a way for me to make examples of how to use the cira library as well as a way to find bugs. Of course paper trader will still be a way for me to experiment with quantitative trading.

If you are interested plz check out [cira](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira), and give it a star on GitHub.
