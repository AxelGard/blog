### Cira v.1.0.0 

* [GitHub](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira/tree/f736b47acfcea9292e0d9b627d5f4b6becec9d87)
* [GitHub tag](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira/releases/tag/v.1.0.0)
* [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cira/1.0.0/)

This will be last version that will use functional programming. 

## whats next 

I have realized that this version might be hard to use for new programmers so I have decied to move more of a classic OOP style.
