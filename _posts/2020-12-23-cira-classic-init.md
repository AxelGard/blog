# Cira-classic 

With the relses of cira v2 comes some major changes of the file structure. 
However some pople are still using the old structre so inorder to keep that structre upp to date I choose to fork cira and create cira-classic. 
So if you like the old style or just want to keep the code that you have written you can. This also allows for furter devleopemnt of the classic structre. 

```bash 
pip install cira-classic
```
if you have allrady code that use this than you can do 

```pyhton
import cira_classic as cira
```
